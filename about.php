        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Since I was 10 years old, I discovered my passion for programming and web development when I created my first HTML webpage. During my teenage years, I worked closely with my brothers‚Äîone a programmer and the other a graphic designer‚Äîallowing me to learn and deepen my understanding of computers and design. My environment exposed me to different operating systems: one of my brothers was an Apple enthusiast, while the other preferred Microsoft and Linux. This gave me the opportunity to gain fundamental knowledge about each system.</p>
        <p>Soon after, I discovered blogs and launched my first tech blog on Blogspot. Later, I learned how to use WordPress as a CMS and developed my first website with basic functions. This experience allowed me to understand how CMS platforms work in real-world projects. Meanwhile, my brother taught me about e-commerce development using Joomla. As I learned more about CSS, HTML, and new technologies like HTML5, I improved my blog by making it responsive and adding animations. This led to my first job as a junior web developer, focused on WordPress, which opened doors to larger and more challenging projects.</p>
        <p>In 2014, my blog "Tecnolog√≠aContigo" was affected by a total loss of the hosting service I was using, and I couldn't recover it. I still regret not saving it, but the desire to blog again remains. Now, in 2024, I‚Äôve decided to rekindle that passion by creating a GitHub account after more than 10 years of experience in the tech industry, currently working with AI and cloud services.</p>
        <p>Most of my knowledge has come from online resources‚Äîblogs, YouTubers, and other programmers who have inspired and helped me learn. I believe it's time to give back, to share my knowledge, and help others along their own learning journeys.</p>
